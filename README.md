# Ticker
The News Ticker project aims to be an useful tool to catch up with recent events and news. It downloads news from few chosen sites and displays it on the news ticker similat to these known from TV. News are obtained in process of scraping websites and whole process has to be programmed separately for each site. This is the major disadvantage, but because of it ticker can be freely configured and displays news satisfying certain criterias.

Due to difficulties with displaying ticker on top of every window right now code is not portable because few lines of code relies on WinAPI.

# Ticker
The News Ticker project aims to be an useful tool to catch up with recent events and news. It downloads news from few chosen sites and displays it on the news ticker similar to these known from TV.

The major disadvantage is that news are obtained in process of scraping websites, which has to be programmed separately for each site.

Due to difficulties with constant and continuous displaying ticker on top of every window right now code is not portable. Unfortunately a few lines of code rely on WinAPI. Further research may allow to port this program to other systems.
